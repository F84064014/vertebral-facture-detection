# Vertebral Facture Detection Based On Machine Learning Method

Our aim is to detect if each vertebra in a given X-ray image is fractured.

# Description

In this project we will use both machine learning and deep learning method. Deep learning method is mainly for detecting the vertebra and vertebra segmentation, then we will extract some critical information form the result of segmentation, these information are taken to be the feature for our machine learning method to identify if the vertebra is fractured, screwed or normal.
